We used FastQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and MultiQC (https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC) for visualizing the quality of raw sequencing data.
Trimmomatic (https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic) is used to trim and filter sequencing reads to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences.
