We used bwa-mem (https://github.com/lh3/bwa) aligner for mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome, followed by generating a bam file, sorting, and indexing using Samtools (https://github.com/samtools/samtools).
Followed by the quality check through BamQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/BamQC) and Qualimap (http://qualimap.conesalab.org/).
